    <string name="dealpool_description">My favourite marvel (Anti)hero is DeadPool. Well, I personally like DC more than Marvel until last year. He is not about saving the world which is what I admire about a character. I always end up praising the villain rather than the hero. Also he gives no f***s whatsoever. A carefree attitude of him is just amazing.</string>
